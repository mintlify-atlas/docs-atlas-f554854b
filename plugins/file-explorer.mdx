description: Navigate your project with nvim-tree and jump between files with Harpoon
---

Two powerful tools for file navigation: nvim-tree for browsing your project structure and Harpoon for lightning-fast jumps between frequently used files.

## nvim-tree

nvim-tree is a file explorer that provides a visual tree view of your project.

### Features

- Git integration showing file status
- File operations (create, delete, rename, move)
- Split opening and tab support
- Custom icons for different file types
- Integration with LSP for automatic import updates

### Configuration

```lua lua/leyland/plugins/nvim-tree.lua
nvimtree.setup({
  view = {
    width = 50,
    relativenumber = true,
    side = "right",
  },
  renderer = {
    indent_markers = {
      enable = true,
    },
  },
  git = {
    ignore = false,  -- Show ignored files
  },
})
```

<Note>
  The tree opens on the right side with relative line numbers and a width of 50 columns.
</Note>

### Keybindings

    | `?` | Show help |
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### File operations

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a file">
    Press `a` and type the filename. Add a trailing `/` to create a directory.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Rename a file">
    Navigate to the file and press `r`. The LSP will automatically update imports.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Delete a file">
    Navigate to the file and press `d`. Confirm the deletion.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Move files">
    Press `x` to cut, navigate to destination, press `p` to paste.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Git integration

nvim-tree shows Git status with icons:

- ✓ Staged files
- ✗ Deleted files
- ● Modified files
- ★ Untracked files
- ⎇ Ignored files (when shown)

<Accordion title="Git file operations">
  When you rename or move files in nvim-tree, the nvim-lsp-file-operations plugin automatically updates imports in other files that reference the moved file.
</Accordion>

## Harpoon

Harpoon is a file navigation tool for marking and quickly jumping between your most important files.

### Concept

Instead of searching for files or using a file tree, you "harpoon" files you're actively working on and jump between them instantly:

1. Mark files you're working on
2. Jump to marked files with number keys
3. See all marked files in a quick menu

### Configuration

```lua lua/leyland/plugins/harpoon.lua
return {
  "ThePrimeagen/harpoon",
  branch = "harpoon2",
  opts = {
    menu = {
      width = vim.api.nvim_win_get_width(0) - 4,
    },
    settings = {
      save_on_toggle = true,
    },
  },
}
```

### Keybindings

| Key | Action | Description |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| `<leader>H` | Add file | Mark current file with Harpoon |
| `<leader>h` | Quick menu | Show all harpooned files |
| `<leader>1` | Jump to file 1 | Jump to first marked file |
| `<leader>2` | Jump to file 2 | Jump to second marked file |
| `<leader>3` | Jump to file 3 | Jump to third marked file |
| ... | ... | Up to `<leader>9` |

### Workflow example

<Steps>
  <Step title="Mark your files">
    Open a file you're working on and press `<leader>H` to harpoon it. Repeat for other files.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Jump between files">
    Press `<leader>1`, `<leader>2`, etc. to instantly jump to your marked files.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Manage marks">
    Press `<leader>h` to open the quick menu and reorder or remove marks.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Quick menu

The Harpoon quick menu shows all your marked files:

- Navigate with `j`/`k`
- Press `<CR>` to jump to a file
- Press `d` to remove a mark
- Reorder files by cutting and pasting lines

<Tip>
  Harpoon is perfect for jumping between related files like a component and its test file, or between a controller and its view.

## Choosing between nvim-tree and Harpoon

<Accordion title="Use nvim-tree when...">
  - Exploring unfamiliar codebases
  - Browsing directory structures
  - Performing file operations (create, rename, delete)
  - Viewing Git status at a glance
  - Finding files you haven't opened yet
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use Harpoon when...">
  - Working on a specific feature across multiple files
  - Jumping between frequently edited files
  - You know exactly which files you need
  - Speed is critical
  - You want to minimize context switching
</Accordion>

<Note>
  Most developers use both: nvim-tree for discovery and file operations, Harpoon for rapid navigation during active development.
