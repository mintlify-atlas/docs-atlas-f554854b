- Preview files before opening
- Search across multiple sources (files, text, Git, LSP, etc.)
- Integration with other plugins

## Configuration

Telescope is configured with sensible defaults and vim-style navigation:

```lua lua/leyland/plugins/telescope.lua
telescope.setup({
  defaults = {
    path_display = { "filename_first" },
    mappings = {
      i = {
        ["<C-k>"] = actions.move_selection_previous,
        ["<C-j>"] = actions.move_selection_next,
        ["<C-q>"] = actions.send_selected_to_qflist + actions.open_qflist,
      },
    },
  },
  pickers = {
    live_grep = {
      path_display = { "truncate" },
    },
  },
})
```
