---

## Welcome to nvim-luffy

This guide will get you productive with nvim-luffy quickly. You'll learn the most important keybindings and workflows to start coding efficiently.

<Note>
  All keybindings use `<Space>` as the leader key. We'll write it as `<Space>` in this guide, but you just press the spacebar.
</Note>

## The Alpha dashboard

When you first open Neovim (or open it without a file), you'll see the Alpha dashboard featuring Luffy's Gear 5 ASCII art and the quote: *"Maybe the One Piece was the commits you made along the way."*

The dashboard provides quick access to common actions:

- **f** - Find file (opens Telescope file finder)
- **r** - Recent files (shows your recently opened files)
- **q** - Quit Neovim

You can simply press these keys to trigger the action, or navigate with `j`/`k` and press `Enter`.

<Tip>
  From the Alpha dashboard, the fastest way to start working is to press `f` and start typing a filename.
</Tip>

## Essential keybindings

### File navigation

These are your most-used keybindings:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Find files" icon="magnifying-glass">
    `<Space><Space>`
    
    Opens Telescope to fuzzy-find files in your current directory. Start typing to filter.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Recent files" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    `<Space>fr`
    
    Shows files you've recently opened. Quick way to jump back to your work.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Live grep" icon="text-size">
    `<Space>/`
    
    Search for text across all files in your project. Results update as you type.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="File explorer" icon="folder-tree">
    `<Space>e`
    
    Toggles nvim-tree file explorer on the right side of your screen.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Harpoon navigation

Harpoon is a powerful feature for quick file switching. Think of it as marking your most important files:

```text lua/leyland/plugins/harpoon.lua
-- Mark current file
<Space>H

-- Open Harpoon menu
<Space>h

-- Jump to specific files
<Space>1  -- Jump to first harpooned file
<Space>2  -- Jump to second harpooned file
<Space>3  -- Jump to third harpooned file
... up to <Space>9
```

<Steps>
  <Step title="Mark your important files">
    Open a file and press `<Space>H` (capital H) to add it to Harpoon.
    
    Mark 3-4 files you're actively working on.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use the quick menu">
    Press `<Space>h` to see all your harpooned files in a menu.
    
    Navigate with `j`/`k` and press `Enter` to open a file.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Jump directly">
    Once files are harpooned, use `<Space>1`, `<Space>2`, etc. to jump instantly to that file.
    
    This is much faster than searching for files!
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Buffer management

```text lua/leyland/core/keymaps.lua
-- Close current buffer
<Space>bd

-- Close all buffers
<Space>ba
```

### Window management

```text lua/leyland/core/keymaps.lua
-- Split window vertically
<Space>|

-- Split window horizontally  
<Space>sh

-- Navigate between windows
<C-h>  -- Move to left window
<C-l>  -- Move to right window
<C-j>  -- Move to bottom window
<C-k>  -- Move to top window
```

<Tip>
  The `Ctrl+h/j/k/l` navigation works seamlessly with tmux thanks to the vim-tmux-navigator plugin.
</Tip>

## Working with Telescope

Telescope is your primary tool for finding files and text. Here's how to use it effectively:

### In the Telescope prompt

<ResponseField name="Ctrl+j / Ctrl+k" type="navigation">
  Move between results (alternative to arrow keys)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Enter" type="action">
  Open the selected file
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Ctrl+q" type="action">
  Send selected results to quickfix list
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Esc" type="action">
  Close Telescope
</ResponseField>

### Telescope keybindings reference

```text lua/leyland/plugins/telescope.lua
<Space><Space>  -- Find files
<Space>fr       -- Recent files (oldfiles)
<Space>/        -- Live grep (search in files)
<Space>fc       -- Find string under cursor
<Space>ft       -- Find TODO comments
<Space>fk       -- Find keymaps
```

<Info>
  Telescope uses fuzzy finding, so you don't need to type the exact filename. For example, typing "usrctl" will find "UserController.ts".
</Info>

## Working with the file explorer

Press `<Space>e` to toggle nvim-tree on the right side:

### File explorer navigation

```text lua/leyland/plugins/nvim-tree.lua
l or Enter  -- Open file or expand directory
h           -- Close directory or go to parent
j/k         -- Navigate up/down
a           -- Create new file
d           -- Delete file
r           -- Rename file
x           -- Cut file
c           -- Copy file  
p           -- Paste file
R           -- Refresh tree
q           -- Close explorer
```

<Tip>
  The explorer uses `h` and `l` for navigation (vim-style), making it intuitive if you're familiar with vim motions.
</Tip>

## LSP features

nvim-luffy comes with full LSP integration. Open any supported file (JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Lua, etc.) and you'll automatically get:

### Automatic features

- **Diagnostics** - Errors and warnings appear inline with virtual text
- **Completion** - Start typing and suggestions appear automatically
- **Signature help** - Function parameter hints as you type
- **Auto-formatting** - Code formats automatically on save

### LSP keybindings

These are available when an LSP is attached to your buffer:

<CodeGroup>

```lua Navigation
gd  -- Go to definition
gr  -- Go to references  
gi  -- Go to implementation
```

```lua Documentation
K   -- Show hover documentation
```

```lua Code actions
<Space>ca  -- Code actions
<Space>rn  -- Rename symbol
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  LSP keybindings are set up automatically in `lua/leyland/plugins/lsp/lsp.lua` when a language server attaches to your buffer.
</Note>

## Completion

The completion menu appears automatically as you type in insert mode:

```text lua/leyland/plugins/nvim-cmp.lua
-- Navigation in completion menu
Ctrl+j       -- Next suggestion
Ctrl+k       -- Previous suggestion
Tab          -- Next suggestion (or expand snippet)
Enter        -- Confirm selection
Ctrl+Space   -- Manually trigger completion
Ctrl+e       -- Close completion menu

-- Documentation scrolling
Ctrl+f       -- Scroll docs down
Ctrl+b       -- Scroll docs up
```

### Completion sources

Completions come from multiple sources:

1. **LSP** - Intelligent code suggestions from language servers
2. **LuaSnip** - Code snippets
3. **Buffer** - Words from the current file
4. **Path** - File system paths

## Flash.nvim - Enhanced motion

Flash provides lightning-fast navigation within files:

```text lua/leyland/plugins/flash.lua
s            -- Flash jump (2-character search)
S            -- Flash treesitter (select syntax nodes)  
Ctrl+Space   -- Incremental treesitter selection

-- In operator-pending mode
r            -- Remote flash
R            -- Treesitter search
```

<Steps>
  <Step title="Press s in normal mode">
    Flash.nvim activates and highlights potential jump locations.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Type two characters">
    Type the two characters where you want to jump.
    
    Labels appear on matching locations.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Press the label key">
    Press the highlighted label key to jump instantly to that location.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Flash is much faster than using `w`, `b`, `f`, or `/` for navigation once you get used to it.
</Tip>

## Tips for success

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with the essentials">
    Focus on mastering these keybindings first:
    - `<Space><Space>` for finding files
    - `<Space>/` for searching text
    - `<Space>e` for file explorer
    - `gd` for go-to-definition
    
    Once these become muscle memory, you'll be incredibly productive.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Harpoon for active files">
    Don't try to remember file paths or search repeatedly. Mark your 3-4 active files with Harpoon and use `<Space>1-4` to jump between them instantly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Learn one plugin at a time">
    Don't try to learn everything at once. Spend a day getting comfortable with Telescope, then add Harpoon to your workflow, then explore LSP features.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Check keymaps anytime">
    Forgot a keybinding? Press `<Space>fk` to open Telescope's keymap finder and search for what you need.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Run :checkhealth regularly">
    If something doesn't work as expected, run `:checkhealth` to diagnose issues with your setup.
