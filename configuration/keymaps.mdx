# Keymaps

This page documents all custom keymaps configured in nvim-luffy. These shortcuts help you navigate and manage your editing environment efficiently.

## Leader key

<Note>
  The leader key is set to **Space**. All keymaps shown with `<leader>` require pressing Space first.
</Note>

```lua
vim.g.mapleader = " "
```

For example, `<leader>|` means: press **Space**, then press **|**.

## Window management

These keymaps help you split and organize your workspace.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Vertical split" icon="grip-lines-vertical">
    **Keymap:** `<leader>|` (Space + Pipe)
    
    Splits the current window vertically, creating a new window to the right.
    
    ```lua
    keymap.set("n", "<leader>|", "<C-w>v", 
      { desc = "Split window vertically" })
    ```
  </Card>

  <Card title="Horizontal split" icon="grip-lines">
    **Keymap:** `<leader>sh` (Space + s + h)
    
    Splits the current window horizontally, creating a new window below.
    
    ```lua
    keymap.set("n", "<leader>sh", "<C-w>s", 
      { desc = "Split window horizontally" })
    ```
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  These keymaps use native Vim window commands (`<C-w>v` and `<C-w>s`) but provide more memorable shortcuts.
</Tip>

## Buffer management

Manage your open files (buffers) with these commands.

### Close single buffer

**Keymap:** `<leader>bd` (Space + b + d)

```lua
keymap.set("n", "<leader>bd", "<cmd>bd<CR>", 
  { desc = "Close buffer" })
```

Closes the current buffer. Think of it as "buffer delete".

### Close all buffers

**Keymap:** `<leader>ba` (Space + b + a)

```lua
keymap.set("n", "<leader>ba", "<cmd>%bd<CR>", 
  { desc = "Close all buffers" })
```

<Warning>
  This closes **all** open buffers. Make sure you've saved your work before using this command.
</Warning>

Think of it as "buffer all" (close all).

## Keymap reference table

| Mode | Keymap | Action | Description |
|------|--------|--------|-------------|
| Normal | `<leader>\|` | `<C-w>v` | Split window vertically |
| Normal | `<leader>sh` | `<C-w>s` | Split window horizontally |
| Normal | `<leader>bd` | `:bd` | Close current buffer |
| Normal | `<leader>ba` | `:%bd` | Close all buffers |

## Commented out keymaps

The source file includes some keymaps that are commented out. You can enable these by uncommenting them in `~/workspace/source/lua/leyland/core/keymaps.lua`.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Quick escape from Insert mode">
    ```lua
    -- keymap.set("i", "jk", "<ESC>", 
    --   {desc = "Exit Insert mode with jk"})
    ```
    
    This would allow you to press `jk` in quick succession to exit Insert mode instead of reaching for the Escape key.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Clear search highlights">
    ```lua
    -- keymap.set("n", "<leader>nh", ":nohl<CR>", 
    --   { desc = "Clear search highlights" })
    ```
    
    This would let you press `<leader>nh` to clear search highlighting. However, nvim-luffy has an autocommand that clears highlights automatically when you move the cursor (see [Autocommands](/configuration/autocommands)).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Adding your own keymaps

You can add custom keymaps using the same pattern:

```lua
local keymap = vim.keymap

keymap.set("mode", "keys", "command", { desc = "Description" })
```

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Parameters">
    - **mode**: `"n"` (Normal), `"i"` (Insert), `"v"` (Visual), etc.
    - **keys**: The key combination to trigger the action
    - **command**: The Vim command or key sequence to execute
    - **desc**: Description shown in which-key or telescope
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Example">
    ```lua
    keymap.set("n", "<leader>w", "<cmd>w<CR>", 
      { desc = "Save file" })
    ```
    
    This creates a keymap that saves the current file when you press Space + w in Normal mode.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
  All keymaps are set in Normal mode (`"n"`) unless otherwise specified. The descriptions are used by plugins like which-key to show helpful hints.
